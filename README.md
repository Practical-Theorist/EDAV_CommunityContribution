This is a translated edition of a Chinese getting started tutorial of D3.js. 

The author of the tutorial is Zhihua lv, and the link for the original edition of the tutorial is: http://wiki.jikexueyuan.com/project/d3wiki/introduction.html 

I encountered this tutorial on a Chinese website, and feel it is concise, learner-friendly and practical, so I formed the idea to translate it from Chinese into English and to benefit people who do not understand Chinese.  

I may finish only a part of the translation of the tutorial, but if I have time, I will keep updating it. 

Thanks for the author Mr. Zhihua Lv again!
